<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project aims to create a system capable of detecting emotions in human voice, such as joy, sadness, anger, or fear. Since humans mainly recognize emotions through nonverbal communication, effective artificial intelligence should be able to better recognize emotions in human voice by using subtle and imperceptible patterns that are difficult to notice at first glance. The system will be implemented using technologies for processing audio signals and artificial intelligence. The implementation of this project can benefit in improving human-machine interactions, allowing the machine to better understand the intentions and needs of the user. Another benefit of this project may be research into the dynamics of emotions in social media and live broadcasts, enabling a better understanding of social reactions. With the development of the project, it is also possible to apply emotion detection in human voice to areas such as medicine. Such systems can be particularly helpful in diagnosing and treating mental health disorders.
